# Welcome to martaizba's Experimentation Space 👋

Hello there! I'm Marta, a cultural anthropologist turned UX specialist. Here, in my little corner of GitHub, you'll find my melting pot of experiments and explorations in the world of code. 

## About Me 🌟

- **Profession:** UX Specialist
- **Interests:** Unraveling the human experience through technology
- **Philosophy:** Understanding code is not just a skill, it's a superpower for holistic professionals!

## Why I'm Here 👀

- **Learning:** I believe in continuous learning, and what better way than experimenting with code!
- **Sharing:** Expect to see a blend of very basic React, Python and many AI failures
- **Connecting:** Let's bridge the gap between UX and code.

## My Projects 🛠️

*Coming soon... Stay tuned for projects that merge cultural insights with user-centric design.*

## Let's Connect! 🤝
